# Disclaimer
I do not represent or work for MySchoolSask. I do not claim copyright or trademark over these images or designs.

# Why
We needed higher-resolution copies of the MySchoolSask logo, to include in our own documentation. I felt that the quality of the existing logos was lacking, and so I often found myself making my own. 
All image files in this repository were created by me.

# Colours and Fonts
* The font used in the official MySchoolSask logo is Open Sans (https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans), created by Steve Matteson and commissioned by Google. 
* The font style is often bold
* The green colour is `#006B35`
* The yellow colour is `#FFE938`
* The white-gray line between green and yellow is white `#FFFFFF` or very light grey `#D9E2DC` (possibly grey due to image compression)
